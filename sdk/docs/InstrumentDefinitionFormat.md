## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**sourceSystem** | **String** | which source system does the format originate from | 
**vendor** | **String** | An instrument will potentially have been created by any number of different organisations. Some will be understood completely (e.g. LUSID&#39;s), some won&#39;t.              The provenance of an instrument indicates who \&quot;owns\&quot; the associated format. | 
**version** | **String** | Version of the document. Would be preferable to avoid the need, but LUSID will not control other organisations&#39; trade formats. |
